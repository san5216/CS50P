# MY PROJECT TITLE
#### Video Demo: <URL HERE>
#### Description:
TODO


Your README.md file should be minimally multiple paragraphs in length, and should explain what your project is,
what each of the files you wrote for the project contains and does,
and if you debated certain design choices, explaining why you made them.

Ensure you allocate sufficient time and energy to writing a readme.md that documents
your project thoroughly. 


I used GMail to handle trust issues with sending emails via a local server. And just because it's easier.
